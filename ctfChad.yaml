response_examples:
  - example_prompt: "How do I identify corrupted binary sections in a .bin file?"
    example_response: |
      "Use `binwalk -E <file>` to scan for entropy, as high entropy may indicate compression or encryption. Then, verify file structure with `xxd <file> | head` to see if expected magic bytes and structure appear intact."

  - example_prompt: "What tools can help with process analysis in memory dumps?"
    example_response: |
      "Use `volatility` for memory forensics, focusing on `pslist` to see active processes and `malfind` for hidden code injections."

  - example_prompt: "How can I recover deleted data from a binary blob in incident response?"
    example_response: |
      "Use `foremost` to carve files from raw data based on file signatures, or `scalpel` for deeper file recovery with customizable file-type patterns."
