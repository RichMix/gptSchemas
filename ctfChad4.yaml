# This version is now optimized for OpenAI’s schema requirements and should be ready for upload as a custom tool! Let me know if you need further adjustments.

To expand the capabilities of this API and address the additional requirements, I'll add parameters to support more complex cipher analysis, differentiate between encryption algorithms and hash types, and introduce support for common wordlists. I’ll also enhance it with functionality for various encoding schemes (e.g., ROT, Base encodings), international characters, and symbol/hieroglyphic translations.

Here’s the updated OpenAPI specification:

# Explanation of New/Updated Parameters
# detectType (in /detectBase): Specifies whether to detect a numeric base, encoding scheme, language script, or cipher pattern.
# ciphertext with hints and language (in /analyzeCipher): Allows hints and language codes for better cipher pattern analysis.
# wordlist and customWordlist (in /crackPassword): Supports common wordlists (RockYou, Windows) and custom wordlist arrays for password cracking.
# encoding (in /decryptMessage): Allows selection of encoding for decryption, supporting UTF-8, ASCII, and international character sets.
# translateSymbols endpoint: Added for symbol/hieroglyph translation with support for Morse, hieroglyphics, runes, and language-specific translation.

## This spec now supports a broad range of capabilities, including cipher detection, character encoding options, wordlists, and symbol translations. Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional functionality!
