# Create spec to upload in your specs creating a GPT to help me with number base detection, password cracking, and decryption for NCL
# To assist with number base detection, password cracking, and decryption in the NCL (National Cyber League) context, I'll create an OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification for a hypothetical API that handles these functionalities. This spec will cover endpoints for base detection, password cracking, and decryption.
# Please ensure that any usage complies with competition rules, as automating certain tasks could be restricted. Hereâ€™s the OpenAPI spec:

This specification includes three main paths:

# /detectBase for determining the base of a given number.
# /crackPassword for attempting to crack a password hash using the specified hash type.
# /decryptMessage for decrypting an encrypted message given an encryption key and algorithm.
# Let me know if you'd like any modifications or additional details for these endpoints!
