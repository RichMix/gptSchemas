# OpenAI YAML Schemas for CTF Bots

This repository includes YAML schemas used to define the configuration and behavior of bots in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. These schemas facilitate efficient communication between CTF bots and provide a flexible, standardized format to customize bot actions based on challenge requirements.

# 2. Introduction
The YAML schemas in this repository define configurable options for CTF bots used in various challenges. By using YAML, the schema provides an easy-to-read and modify configuration file that can specify bot behavior, challenge parameters, authentication, and other key details necessary for effective interaction in CTF environments.

# 3. Schema Structure
Each schema file typically contains fields for:

Metadata: Information about the bot's purpose, author, and version.
Environment Variables: Settings for the environment the bot operates in, like API keys or endpoints.
Challenge Configurations: Parameters specific to the CTF challenge, such as flags, time limits, and scoring.
Action Scripts: Defines scripts or commands the bot will execute during the challenge.
Output Handling: Specifies how results are processed or outputted by the bot, including logging and report generation.

# 4. Key Components

Metadata
Provides basic information about the bot, including:

name: The name of the bot.
description: Brief description of the bot's role.
author: Name of the bot developer.
version: Versioning information for tracking updates.
Environment Variables
Defines any necessary environment variables, such as:

API keys: Needed for accessing secure resources.
Endpoints: Specifies URLs or IP addresses for target services.
Authentication: Configures tokens, user credentials, etc., for secure access.
Challenge Configurations
This section includes configuration details specific to each CTF challenge:

flag_format: Defines the expected format of flags, useful for parsing and validation.
time_limit: Sets a time limit for challenges that are time-bound.
max_attempts: Limits the number of allowed attempts for challenges to prevent rate limiting.
Action Scripts
Defines the specific actions the bot can perform:

scripts: Lists scripts to be executed.
commands: Custom commands relevant to the challenge.
retry: Specifies retry attempts in case of failure.
Output Handling
Provides options for handling output:

logging: Enables logging with different verbosity levels.
reporting: Specifies if output reports should be generated.
error_handling: Defines actions in case of errors, like retries or logging errors for review.

# 5. Schema Example

# yaml
metadata:
  name: "CTFBot123"
  description: "Automated bot for CTF challenges"
  author: "CTF Dev Team"
  version: "1.0.0"

environment:
  api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
  endpoint: "https://ctf.example.com"
  authentication:
    username: "user123"
    password: "secure_password"

challenge:
  flag_format: "CTF{[A-Z0-9]+}"
  time_limit: "300s"
  max_attempts: 5

actions:
  scripts:
    - "flag_hunt.sh"
  commands:
    - "curl -X POST {endpoint}/login"
    - "python extract_flag.py --input data.log"
  retry: 3

output:
  logging: "verbose"
  reporting: true
  error_handling: "log_and_retry"

# 6. Usage

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to work locally.

# bash
git clone https://github.com/your_repo/ctf-bot-yaml-schemas.git

Configure the Schema: Modify the schema fields as necessary to fit the specifics of the CTF challenge. Adjust environment variables, scripts, and actions to align with the task requirements.

Execute Bot: Run the bot with the configured YAML schema. Ensure that the bot is tested in a safe environment before deploying in a live CTF setting.

# bash
./run_bot.sh --config path/to/schema.yaml
Monitor Output: Monitor the bot's actions using logs, and review reports generated as specified in the schema configuration.

# 7. Best Practices
Keep Sensitive Data Secure: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys in the schema. Instead, use environment variables or secure storage options.
Test Configuration: Test the schema configuration in a local or staging environment to ensure smooth bot performance in real-time challenges.
Handle Errors Gracefully: Configure error handling and retry logic to prevent the bot from failing unexpectedly.
Use Versioning: Track changes to schema files by maintaining version numbers and changelogs.
